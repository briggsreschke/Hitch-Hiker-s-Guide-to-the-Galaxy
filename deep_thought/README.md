**Print a randomly selected quote to terminal** ... probably a more poetic way to do it .....
* **42.txt** is Douglas Adams passages ... but could be any list of quotes  
* **quoted.py** (pretty prints it, adjusting for terminal cols)  
* **deep_thought.py** (grabs a random quote from a **.txt file**)
