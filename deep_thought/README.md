#### Print a randomly selected quote to terminal ... could be any quote
I use them in .bashrc to print a quote when I open a term, and for a twitter bot

* **42.txt** is Douglas Adams passages ... but could be any list of quotes  
* **quoted.py** (pretty prints it, adjusting for terminal cols)  
* **deep_thought.py** (grabs a random quote from **.txt file**)
