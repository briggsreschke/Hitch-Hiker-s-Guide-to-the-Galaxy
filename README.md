#### HHG.csv is a comma delimited database of Douglas Adams Quotes from the first three books 
(HHG, REU, LUE)

* Left some quotes from HHG out on purpose but will probably add them   
* Removed page numbers since not consistent across editions

#### deep_thought/ is python scripts to pretty print random quotes from a txt file (.bashrc, twitterbot, ...) 

* Can be any list of quotes
