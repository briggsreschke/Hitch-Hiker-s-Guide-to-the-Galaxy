**HHG.csv** is a comma delimited database of Douglas Adams Quotes from the first three books (HHG, REU, LUE). Left out some quotes from HHG on purpose but will probably add them. Removed page numbers since not consistent across editions.

**deep_thought/** is python scripts to pretty print random quotes from a txt file.
